# Most influential books for programmers

These are books considered most influential for programmers from this [StackOverflow thread](1).


## Why on Github?

Cause SO is cathedral, Github is bazzar ;)

Long answer: I frequently visit above thread. Over the time, such an active thread is closed, links to book sites are removed and I have to copy/paste/search everytime I go there. I am afraid they might remove it entirely.

So, the list is preserved here :)
