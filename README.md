Most influential books for programmers
---
These are books considered most influential for programmers from this StackOverflow thread.


Why another list?
---
Cause SO is cathedral, Github is bazzar ;)

Long answer: I frequently visit above thread. Over the time, such an active thread is closed, links to book sites are removed and I have to copy/paste/search everytime. I am afraid they might remove it entirely.

So, the list is preserved here :)
