# Most influential books for programmers

These are books considered most influential for programmers from this [StackOverflow thread](1).


## Why on Github?

Cause SO is cathedral, Github is bazzar ;)

Long answer: I frequently visit above thread. Over the time, such an active thread is closed, links to book sites are removed and I have to copy/paste/search everytime I go there. I am afraid they might remove it entirely.

So, the list is preserved here :)

## Contribue ♥ ♥ ♥

Any book which is significantly influential can be added or one which seems not so can be removed. I have tried to put official book site, link to electronic version, and finally Amazon page if both don't exist. Please add an issue in case links are not working or are not official.

## Original thread

What is the single most influential book every programmer should read?

If you could go back in time and tell yourself to read a specific book at the beginning of your career as a developer, which book would it be?

I expect this list to be varied and to cover a wide range of things.
